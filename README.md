#Secret-Smithsonian
Welcome to the Secret Smithsonian project

## Purpose
At the Office of Digital Design and Innovation, we were inspired by the original demonstration of Google Goggles and wanted to explore ways that we could prepare for it.

We elected to create a smartphone+tablet based application that would allow users to 'unlock' certain news items when located close to a particular item.  Since we are located in Washington, DC we elected to use the many museums of the Smithsonian for Subject Matter.

##Tech Choices

###Native app? Titanium app?  Web App?
Speed of development was critical because we needed to create a prototype as quickly as possible to gauge user reaction to this project.

We originally started working with Titanium, but decided to switch to building a web app to work around the limitations that come from being locked into the app stores.  

We may, however, look into ways to turn this into a native application to facilitate a broader distribution spectrum.

###Google Maps or Mapbox?
We elected to use Mapbox because it gives our maps a unique 'feel' and also provides some options down the road for offline caching and the use of the TileMill application.


##Future Enhancements	

We envision creating tools to facilitate very easy creation of location based content that powers the app
